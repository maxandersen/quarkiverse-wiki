# quarkiverse-wiki

This repository is automatically forcefully synced to Quarkiverse wiki (any manual edits directly on wiki will be lost) on push to master.

Making it so that edits to wiki can be done by anyone and then merged after review. Opposite to normal github wiki where edits can only be done by contributors with push access.
